    Imagine you want to create a re-usable bootstrap panel. Since it is reusable, the consumer
    of that panel component should be able to provide the content of that panel.
    We use ngContent for this.

    Here, this component is the consumer of bootstrap-panel component.

    Note: Bootstrap Panel is dropped in Bootstrap 4, hence it will not be visible in a panel

<app-bootstrap-panel>
  <div class="heading">Heading</div>
  <div class="body">
    <h2>
      Body
    </h2>
    <p>Some content goes here...</p>
  </div>
</app-bootstrap-panel>
